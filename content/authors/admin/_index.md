In Fall 2019, I am starting the PhD program in CS at [https://www.cs.wisc.edu  UW-Madison]. I completed my undergraduate studies at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece. I am currently doing research at Computation and Reasoning Lab (CoReLab) of ECE, NTUA, under the supervision of Prof. [http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/ Dimitris Fotakis] who has also supervised my undergraduate thesis. My interests lie in Algorithms and Probability.
